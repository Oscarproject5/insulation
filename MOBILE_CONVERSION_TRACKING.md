### Forms That Track Conversions:

   - Both desktop and mobile responsive versions
   - Tracks on successful submission
   - Sends enhanced user data

2. **Homepage Mobile Form** (`/`)

### How Mobile Forms Work:

```javascript
// Both mobile and desktop forms use the same tracking
handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  // ... validation ...
  if (result.success) {
    // Track conversion with enhanced data
    trackFormConversion(formData);
  }
}
```
