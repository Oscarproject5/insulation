## üéØ **Enforcement Strategies**

### **1. Pre-Task Setup**
Before asking Claude to create pages, first say:
```
I need you to create pages for my site. 

First, acknowledge you've reviewed these files:
1. WORKFLOW.md - the process to follow
2. PAGE_PLAN.md - the page specifications
3. siteConfig.js - the style constants
4. pageContent.js - the content database

Confirm you will:
- ONLY use existing components
- NEVER create custom styles
- ALWAYS use PageTemplate
- FOLLOW the exact workflow

Reply with "Confirmed" and I'll give you the first page to create.
```

### **2. Reference Enforcement**
```
When creating this page, you MUST:
- Reference WORKFLOW.md line 51-82 for Page Template usage
- Use styles from siteConfig.js lines 15-45
- Get content from pageContent.js lines [XXX]
- Follow mobile patterns from ConsistentStyles.md lines 170-210

Show me the exact line numbers you're referencing for each section.
```

### **3. Component-Only Mode**
```
You are in COMPONENT-ONLY mode:

ALLOWED:
‚úÖ Import from src/components/common/
‚úÖ Import from src/data/siteConfig.js
‚úÖ Use PageTemplate
‚úÖ Use existing button/card styles

FORBIDDEN:
‚ùå Creating new components
‚ùå Writing custom CSS
‚ùå Hardcoding any values
‚ùå Creating new style classes

If you need something that doesn't exist, ask first.
```

## üîÑ **Iterative Correction Method**

If Claude creates something that doesn't follow the workflow:

```
This doesn't follow WORKFLOW.md. Please revise:

ISSUES:
1. Line 23: Custom button style instead of siteConfig.buttonStyles.primary
2. Line 45: Hardcoded color #FF6B35 instead of siteConfig.colors.primary.orange
3. Missing PageTemplate wrapper
4. No SEO component

REVISE following WORKFLOW.md exactly. Reference the specific line numbers from siteConfig.js for each style you use.
```

---

## üöÄ **Batch Creation Prompt**

For creating multiple pages efficiently:

```
Create all 5 service pages in sequence:

For EACH page:
1. Read PAGE_PLAN.md section 2.[1-5]
2. Follow WORKFLOW.md exactly
3. Use pageContent.services[slug] for content
4. Apply consistent structure:
   - PageTemplate wrapper
   - SEO from seoTemplates
   - Hero ‚Üí Benefits ‚Üí Process ‚Üí FAQ ‚Üí CTA
5. Name files: src/pages/services/[ServiceName].jsx

Create them in this order:
1. SprayFoam.jsx (section 2.1)
2. BlownIn.jsx (section 2.2)
3. Attic.jsx (section 2.3)
4. Wall.jsx (section 2.4)
5. Commercial.jsx (section 2.5)

After each page, confirm it follows the workflow before proceeding.
```

## üí° **Pro Tips for Consistency**

### **1. Start with a Reference**
Always begin prompts with:
```
Following WORKFLOW.md and using components from src/components/common/...
```

### **2. Prohibit Creativity**
Add to prompts:
```
Do not create any new components or styles. Only use what exists in siteConfig.js.
```

### **3. Require Verification**
End prompts with:
```
After creating, list which workflow steps you followed and which components you used.
```

### **4. Use Examples**
Reference existing pages:
```
Create this page similar to how SprayFoam.jsx was created, following the same pattern.
```
